# UNIT TEST

## In `back` container, in nest_app root:
`npm run test:watchall`

**What is a unit test**:
A unit test is so-called because it focuses on testing a single unit of code in isolation, which can be a function, a class method, or a small group of tightly related functions or methods. The purpose of unit testing is to verify that the individual units of code work as expected in isolation from the rest of the application.

*Advantages*:

* Isolation: You can focus on a specific piece of functionality, making it easier to locate and fix bugs.

* Fast Execution: Unit tests are generally faster to execute since they don't involve the entire application or complex external systems.

* Reliability: When tests are isolated and have controlled dependencies (using mocks/fakes), they become more reliable and consistent.

* Maintenance: Since unit tests are smaller and more focused, they are easier to maintain and update when code changes.

* Test Coverage: By testing each unit of code in isolation, you can achieve higher test coverage and have more confidence in the overall correctness of your application.
